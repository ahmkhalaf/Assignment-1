					<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
				</div>

				<div class="sectionContent">
				<p>Since I first started programming in the block-based programming language Scratch in primary school, my interest in IT has been centred around coding and creating programmes from scratch. When it comes to coding, I get a sense of accomplishment when I create my code from scratch and get it to function flawlessly. As the years passed and I began using more sophisticated programming languages, my interest in IT grew. I began to wonder how each technological device I owned operated and how it functioned, as well as how humans were able to make such rapid advancements in technology. Since then, anything IT-related has always piqued my curiosity, and I find myself trying to understand how it works. I would say that the person that sparked my interest in IT would be my dad. </p>
				<p>My dad studied database oracle which meant that he was always carrying some sort of technology, so it was only natural that I would grow to be interested in it. Regarding my IT experience, I studied two classes in high school that are most closely related to IT: Computer Science and Digital Technologies. As we used a variety of programmes during the year in computer science, including Python, HTML, CSS, Java, and SQL databases, we were given a wide range of tasks to complete. For our senior project in high school, we created a website that incorporated all the programmes that I listed above. While in digital technologies we were made to build a robot body on the computer software Fusion 360, we were then made to print the robot body using a 3D printer. After doing so we were tasked with programming the robot to do certain things.</p>
				<h2>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h2>
				<p>I decided to attend RMIT because they were the most helpful in educating me about what I needed to do to enrol. As a new student from New Zealand, where the educational system differs slightly from ours, RMIT was extremely helpful in directing me along the path I needed to take to reach my goal. RMIT, in my opinion, is always prepared to assist you step by step and is always straightforward and transparent in their communication with you, which made me feel at peace and at ease when it came to applying to and studying for RMIT.</p>
				<h2>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h2>
				<p>I want to find out how society is impacted by IT and how new IT developments might benefit the entire world. When it comes to technology, IT encompasses a wide range of topics, making it hard to understand anything and everything about it in the allotted 13 weeks. Because of this, I hope to learn the essential elements of IT and how it affects us in this limited amount of time. Some of the main things that I wish to learn are the influence of social media, data collection, and virtual reality are a few of the primary things that I want to study.</p>

				<article>
					<h2>Software Engineer</h2>
					<h3>Description</h3>
					<p>With the job that I have chosen is of a company called Two Bridges, Two Bridges are a company that designs and develop software for other companies, their line of business ranges from developing an educational software all the way to developing a delivery management software. I must be able to design and develop for a business with a small team in order to be successful in this position. This job appeals to me because I enjoy programming, creating software, and helping people and/or businesses with the software I create. Therefore, a position like this one where I get to create and develop software with a team of people truly appeals to me.</p>
					<h3>Skills I have</h3>
					<p>Since I do not have a degree in software engineering, the abilities I currently possess are really basic. However, I am on the right track to obtaining the necessary credentials for this position. Python, HTML, CSS, Java, and SQL databases are just a few of the abilities I picked up during my time in high school. Regarding having a job that fits this specification, I do not have any experience, but I do have expertise utilising the programs that I have listed to design and develop a website for my school. The highest qualification that I have achieved is NCEA level 3(National Certificate of Educational Achievement at Level 3)</p>
					<h3>Skills I Need</h3>
					<p>For this position, you must possess a strong skill set, a degree in software development or engineering, and at least five years of professional experience. The five years of experience necessary for this position is justified by the breadth of abilities you must possess, including proficiency in the programming languages C# and SQL as well as knowledge of Angular, React, Node, Linux/Docker, Amazon Web Services, mobile app development, and PHP framework.</p>
					<h3>Learning Plan</h3>
					<p>After I finish with the two courses that I am doing right now, I would’ve by then achieved the English prerequisite which I need to meet to be able to apply for Bachelor of Software Engineering which is what I am aiming for. After I graduate, I'll apply for a junior post that, after five years, will offer me the training and experience I need to be able to apply for a job resembling the one I've chosen.</p>

				<h1>Personality Profile</h1>

				<article>
				<h2>Personality test results</h2>
				<p></p>
				<h3>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</h3>
				<p>According to my test findings, I might not be able to fit into every job because some require a certain personality type that I have not yet formed. However, depending on my test results, it might also imply that I can acquire a job that other individuals with different test results cannot. These test findings may aid me in locating the ideal career for me and assist my company in understanding my style of operation at work.</p>
				<h3>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h3>
				<p>These findings will aid in my understanding of my ability to be productive and efficient, which will aid in my understanding of how well I can collaborate with my team. I also completed a creativity test that demonstrated my capacity for teamwork and helped me understand how my ideas might benefit the group if I were to contribute them. With the help of the creativity test I did, I was able to determine how well I could collaborate with others and whether I could always come up with ideas when I needed to.</p>
				<h3>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h3>
				<p>Taking these tests have helped me recognize that if I need to work with a team and produce the best work possible, I need a team that can do things that I cannot do, and thus I should also be able to help and aid my team things they can’t do but I can, a team always needs a leader, and based on my test results, I am not yet qualified to fill that role. Instead, my role in the team would mostly involve carrying out the necessary tasks and coming up with suggestions that could aid the group in realising its larger goals.</p>

				<h1>Project Idea</h1>
			</div>

			<div class="sectionContent">
				<article>
					<h2>Overview</h2>
					<p>My project idea is to create a smartphone application that not only reads the terms and conditions for any selected application or website, but also points out and illuminates any terms or conditions that might not be to your liking or that could land you in serious legal trouble. This project proposal is meant to assist those who frequently find themselves at the centre of legal problems after failing to read the terms and conditions. The terms and conditions can be read using this programme, which is designed for smartphones, either through the camera on the device or by reading a pdf file.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Motivation</h2>
					<p>Since most people never read the terms and conditions of an application they have just opened or installed, this project might really come in handy. Not doing so could get you in serious trouble because you wouldn't know what you are and aren't permitted to do with the application. Many people could benefit from using this programme to stay out of conflict with the law, saving them money and time instead of having to hire an attorney only to review the terms and conditions for them. People will likely be interested in this idea because something like it is always valuable.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Description</h2>
					<p>This application will be able to read the terms and conditions to any application the user wants, once the user has chosen a terms and conditions for the application to read, the application will then start the process of reading the terms and conditions from top to bottom from the chosen application. After the application is done reading the terms and conditions which sometimes could take a while depending on how long and how many conditions the chosen application has, the application will then search its huge database that is filled with things that it should look out for, once the application has gone through the entirety of the database it will then flag each and every condition that many other people have found issues with.</p>
					<p>The application will then notify the user of its finding and show him the flagged conditions that may cause him any trouble, the user is then prompt to either accept these conditions or decline them. If the user chooses to accept these conditions an notification will pop up and inform him of all the risks he is taking by accepting these terms and conditions, but if the user wishes to decline these terms and conditions he then will be notified that he won’t be able to use the application that he had chosen due to him declining and that if he does choose to accept due to the fact that he need to use the application the terms and conditions reader application will come up with a warning telling the user to accept at their own risk.</p>
					<p>The application will also reveal to the user why each flagged condition is flagged and why he should be wary of it, a great example of how terms and conditions could be dangerous not to read would be when say for example your child is on a game application on your phone and you have your credit card linked and your child buys in-game content, in most cases these game will not allow a refund due to their terms and conditions and therefore the parent won’t be able to get any of their money back but with this project application I plan to put an end to that as some applications do allow a refund but only for a certain period of time which is why my project idea would be useful as it would highlight things as such.</p>
					<p>Another excellent feature that the product would have would be warning its users about applications with unfair or too many flagged terms and conditions. This service could come at a paid price or a premium as it could be especially useful to the user to help them stay away from dangerous applications that could get them into legal trouble. The project application would have a database full of applications that are known to be unfair to the user and applications that the project application has collected data on through the uses of the end user.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
					<p>I will be using the application Appy pie to build and create the software and UI necessary to get the application running and then I will be using another application called android studio to create a pdf reader so that the application is able to read any terms and conditions pdf it is given. Android studio will also be used to create the software that is able to scan through the terms and conditions and flag what it need to flag. The last application which will be useful in creating my project application will be SQLite as it is a database application that will help me store all the terms and conditions that need to be flagged.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Skills Required</h2>
					<p>The skills required to build this application would be to have a complete understanding of the following applications Appy pie, Android studio and SQLite. You would need to have an understanding in each of these applications as they are the building blocks of this application, the skills that you can achieve by learning these applications can all be learnt from online resources such as YouTube and other websites that offer courses on these applications.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Outcome</h2>
					<p>Since the only goal of this application is to assist users in avoiding legal issues, the results would be fantastic if it were ever to be successful. People not reading the terms and conditions is the only issue that led to the creation of this project, and this application will undoubtedly contribute to resolving that issue. Due to the fact that most legal disputes result in a significant financial loss, if not all of them, this project proposal will have a significant impact.</p>
